This project addresses energy-efficient resource allocation in Downlink OFDMA networks, aiming to optimize resource allocation for better energy efficiency in wireless communication systems, particularly in base stations and mobile devices with power constraints. While high SE is commonly achieved, it does not always guarantee high EE, making energy-efficient system design essential. This work explores the Modified Dynamic Subcarrier Assignment algorithm for subcarrier allocation and uses the BPA as a benchmark for power allocation. Additionally, it proposes alternative power allocation methods, including the GA and SQP, which show higher EE compared to the BPA.
